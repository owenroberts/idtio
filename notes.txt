5.1.2018
- need to clean up back and forth w server and client
- need to add a new character to test
- response when character is not available ...

5.3.2018
- multiple players from raining chain
5.7.2018
	- list of sockets and players
	- seems pointless but see where it goes
	- update position
- ep 5 - oop and bullets
	- entity object for player and bullets
	- i prob dont have other moving things but maybe?
	- extending player object with functions from socket events
	- need to oop my code
- maybe if you satisfy some parameters than you can chat in lines font
- change animation state 
	- either in backend on movement
	- or in front using x/y speed

5.8.2018
- can't set game interval multiple times
- intro screen msg if characters aren't available, only show available characters
- player attacks vid
	- mouse events (not for shooting bullets)
	- distance 

5.9.2018
- login system
	- uses mongo, maybe dont need this
	- maybe use firebase instead?

5.11.2018
- client state
	- // init - all data on player
	- // update - only changed data
		- sending all data for players ....
		- he sort of does too
	- // remove - if player is removed

5.18.2018
- player v player
	- get init pack and get update pack
	- only send changed values (eventually) how to see if they changed
- polishing and map
	- player stays in center, map moves relative
	- client takes position and subtracts from player position
- hosting
	- heroku
- map system
	- using 2 different maps
	- 

6.5.2019
- oops
- figure out player movement
6.6.2018
	- now figure out interactives
- performance profiling
	- text very expensive (not using text except for stats)
	- this could be useful for bc
	- adds a canvas for the score (this doesn't help me because lines always need to be redrawn)
	- server profiling
		- npm install v8-profiler
		- const profiler = require('v8-profiler');
		const fs = require('fs');
- user interface and player commands
	- adding html buttons - dont need this
- chat and private message - skip for now
- inventory and multi files
	- ./Entity.js
	- player and interactive and bkg could all be entities
	- inventory from HTML5 game example
	- what items a player has i guess
	- come back when adding flowers etc
- item system
	- didn't really address where items go on the canvas ...

6.7.2018
- save player progress
	- i guess i probably should save the user progress....
	- firebase vs mongo 
- scenery in scene
- letter system/ui
	- actually not too hard!	
	- text should go in game lib?

- interactives in scene
	- collision change
6.8.2018
6.11.2018
	- send to socket
6.12.2018
	- clear up msg/text names
- clear up naming entity, item, interactive etc server/client
- trigger animation state after interactive text
	- interactive trigger state
	- capture player input

6.18.2018
- beach asset
	- prob don't need states for scenery
	- make default no state

- pick ups
	- not playing first frame
	- disappears after interact ... this what i want but now how i want it

6.19.2018
	- no should leave broken stem ding dong ...
	- tell server its been picked
		- issues here
		- is flower on one players map same as flower on another?
		- once that flower is picked can other players not pick it?
		- if not, how do we keep track of which players have which items?
		- and if that's the case, how are items repopulated?
			- when players leaves (dies)?
		- how does this effect game mechanics?
			- same items
				- players need to share resources
				- can player share resources?
				- grow back animation?
				- finite number of conversation to be had in any one session
			- diff items
				- players are viewing different versions of the same world
				- don't worry about sharing resources
				- if they want to talk can go to the same place and both pick same flower
				- that's not that interesting
				- but easier
		- other game mechanic issues
			- limit number of resources players can own at one time
			- players "drop" resources?
	- send pickup states for new players
	- only show available players

6.20.2018
- cant trigger animations on client bc have to happen on all sockets
	- animation interactions are part of main update
- should all interactives be display to all users, or just the pickups
	- go with all for now

6.21.2018
- front end should just worry about front end, turn of change state momentarily
- play once should end itself ... 

6.22.2018
- animation state change vs position change
- only send necessary package info
	- raining change send player id + position every time
- move interact input to server .... 
- entity basically is interactive since scenery doesnt exist on back end

- need better name for interactive
	- client - item - interactive - scenery

- front end, sprite and animation classes, interactive, etc, extend

6.26.2018
- using lines branch classy, merge to master at some point
- less anonymous functions
- ui data

6.28.2018
- hide the character interface
- init pack

- player interactions
	- new flower
	- flower animation for scratch
	- player dialog options

6.29.2018
- fix reload errors

7.2.2018
	- player animation to trigger
	- can't play full state for icons because it switches between multiple ones ...
		- either fix with new wiggle version
		- or write some code to make this work ...

7.3.2018
- picks up flower before entering


7.5.2018
7.6.2018
- map borders - map edges
- skip drawing if sprite isn't in scene
- wiggle should be smaller increments

7.9.2018
- need ocean coverage
- ocean would be better at the bottom maybe

7.10.2018
- starting first interaction
- need spreadsheet of dialogs
- ui join, instructions, sound, weather
- lines - focus the canvas - shift c - different fix, only ignoring key for text type
- lines - missing key commands
- lines - pop lines from selected drawings - integrate with regular remove segment ? 
- lines - see all drawings - add and subtract
- lines - better wiggling
- lines - change layer color
- lines - maybe a better method is appending the drawing to Lines.lines
	- end up with two copies of the drawing ... 
	- need a better way of using panels
	- will worry about it later !

7.11.2018
- get rid of bubbles when talking
- problems with sync
- need a system to do dialog, too crasy to have 1000 frame dialogs
- maybe use text as back up .... 

7.12.2018
- experiment with speed and effects
- fixing story interaction
	- redraw interfaces to work at -width/4 -height/2
	- fix icon alignment
	- playedOnceCallback should be onPlayedOnce & onPlayedState
	- if one character does not have a resource?
	- exit just clear everything .... 
- after resources are used should they reappear?
	- if player uses a resource, they don't have it anymore so doesn't get returned when they leave
	- maybe a time out?
7.14.2018
- fuckinnnn reduce? and map? nahhh
- saving files with wrong number of points

7.16.2018 
- lines - range interface input in the display box
- flowers growing back
- 5 graves - grave yard scenery
- 2 apple trees
- 5 apples

7.17.2018
- map tools and labels
- spine 
- flowers grow back

- interact states for player, entity
	- player
		- in range of item
		- interacting with item
		- in range of player
		- chose a story
		- telling the story

7.19.2018
7.20.2018
- player interactions
	- either
		- do everything at once and prevent second time through
	- or
		- let everything happen twice ... 
		- this might be the answer
		- but story starter has to happen at the same time

7.22.2018
- starting to drag with void + river delta + two hills
	- too much detail in these drawings prob
	- hills are not fit to canvas
	- neither river
	- void is
	- u is like 10 d is still like 10
	- need stats smoothing to actually read it
	- read this someday: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46300964/requestanimationframe-javascript-constant-frame-rate-smooth-graphics#
	
7.23.2018
- showing one interactive but triggering another ...
	- shortest distance?  fuck that ... 

- lines explode order with multiple layers
- drawings - indicate what drawings are in frames
- error with fit canvas to frame

7.25.2018
- sand tool ??
	- yeaah


7.26.2018

7.29.2018
- random frame animation function?
- save frames option to fit to canvas

7.30.2018
- need dialog system - at least for the conference and realistically this is the only way to go
- alphabets for each character
- use the text class
- make a default speech bubble that not closed
- start with just one letter at a time
	- maybe add explode animation to animate ... useful for other stuff probably
- have to set up timing as well
- use csv? story data gets much bigger
- loading is slow
	- move map load to on init ?
	- shouldn't really be waiting for data so it must be building everything in load functions
- exit button

- lines change layer order
- lines setups - defaults ... 
- loading screen
- resources timeout
- player timeout
- will there be an error when one player leaves a story or turns off tab for a while?


- lowdb?
- possible separate x and y wiggle

- more map assets
- move map stuff?
	- https://github.com/typicode/lowdb

- instructions

- is interacting conflicting with char and pickup 

- stop player controls when interacting
	- not sure i care at this point
- can player keep reference to socket?
- Game.width is really window.width .... 
	- also don't really need to know Game.width on the client
- something to kick player off when they stop doing stuff
- window resize
- picks up two flowers at once
- figure out center without calling it over and over
	- for ui, interactive classes, could just center the perm x
	- for sprite could introduce origin or offest value
